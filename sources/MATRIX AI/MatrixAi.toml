short_description = "The invention of Bitcoin in 2008 symbolized the advent of cryptocurrency. The succeeding\nyears witnessed a dramatic growing of the blockchain technology. The introduction of\nEthereum opened the path for supporting complex business behaviors with cryptocurrencies.\nThe overall momentum of development, however, is now facing a series of key challenges.\nThese include: (1) slow transaction speed; (2) programming barrier of smart contracts; (3) lack\nof security in smart contracts; and (4) inflexibilities in managing and updating blockchains.\nDesigned to be the new generation blockchain, MATRIX leverages the latest artificial\nintelligence technology to resolve the abovementioned challenges. The fusion of blockchain\nand AI technologies enables MATRIX to build a revolutionary cryptocurrency, which support\nsignificantly boosted transaction speed, superior accessibility to general users, enhanced\nsecurity under malicious attacks, and highly flexible operations."
