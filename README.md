Verified and machine readable blockchain metadata.

If you are blockchain developer you can easily enrich metadata of system you are building.

Trying to solve the problem of cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets metadata, this repository accumulate dependencies, specs, logos, links and other sensitive metadata.

Rationale behind Chaingear you can find in a paper: [cyber•Rating: Cryptoproperty Evaluation](https://github.com/cyberFund/cyberrating.org/blob/master/paper.md#8-cryptoproperty-identification).

## API
Link to stable version is not published yet:
[chaingear.cyber.fund/v1.json](chaingear.cyber.fund/v1.json)

Unstable version could be found here:
[chaingear.cyber.fund/chaingear.json](http://chaingear.cyber.fund/chaingear.json)

## What benefits of adding to Chaingear?

1. Make your system understandable for people.
All meaningful information about system you develop should be gathered in one place in order to gain more adaption.
2. Make your system accessible for other developers. It will make significantly easier to deal with your token for any wallet, exchange, bridge and any web app which want to work with your cryptocurrency or cryptoasset.
2. Your system is listed in cyber•Fund's Radar or Rating for free.
We are continuously working on attraction of investors to blockchain based projects.

## How to add a system?
We support 4 types of a systems:
- `cryptocurrency`
- `cryptoasset`
- `cryptoservice`
- `cyptoproject`

For every type data structure is quite similar, but requirements are differs.

Meta description is a simple text file in [`toml`](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) format.
```toml
system = "Bitcoin"
icon = "bitcoin.png"
type = "cryptocurrency"
```

### Steps to add system in Chaingear
- Clone `chaingear` repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `cg add {system type}`

```
 Now the process is not automated, so:
- Create a folder at `/chaingear/sourses`. Name of the folder should be same as a `system` name
- Copy desired type of a system from `/templates` into a folder you created
- Rename `example.toml` to a `system` name
```

- Fill out `.toml` file in accordance with [specs](#specification-of-.toml-file).
- Pull request

cyber•Fund's Team in short time will review and merge it.

### Requirements

Any system that follow basic digital property requirements could be added.
This is closed list of such requirements:
- We allow listing of cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets that are **cryptoproperty compliant**.
- We allow listing of publicly traded cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets.
- We allow listing of cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets based on crowdinvesting valuation with fixed cap until cryptocurrency or cryptoasset goes to market.

### What is cryptoproperty compliance?
We are going to publish a paper soon that explain a lot of stuff. But now the following requirements exist:

All systems regardless of the type should have:
- Website
- Community forum / Thread on specialized forum (like [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org))
- Public communication channel: Blog/Twitter/Reddit/Slack etc.  

### Cryptocurrency Listing:
- Should be established and uniquely identifiable via Genesis ID.
- Should have underlying internal capital - a cryptocurrency responsible for resilience of network consensus.
- Core code responsible for network consensus should be open source, buildable and executable for at least one open source operating system.
- Should have blockchain explorer wich can disclose information about: blocks, addresses, transactions, numbers of nodes/peers/witnesses

### Cryptoasset Listing:
- Should be registered using listed cryptocurrency and uniquely identifiable via Genesis ID.
- Registration protocol should be defined by a code (Counterparty, Omni, NXT AE, NXT Monetary System etc.) and/or natural language (protocol specification such as Open Assets protocol, AGS, etc.)
- Purpose of registration should be described by a code (e.g. smart contracts), and/or natural language (e.g. Ricardian contract or signed Shareholders agreement)

### Cryptoproject Listing
-

### Cryptoservice Listing

### What if I have a private cryptocurrency or cryptoasset?
No problem. It could be registered using Chaingear library and will be listed in Radar. So when your brainchild will be ready to be publicly traded it will be included in Rating automagicaly. Follow [cyber•Fund Radar](https://cyber.fund/radar) listing section.

### What if I don't have a token yet?
If you are not going to issue a token or create an independent system we could not add your

You can discuss or ask a question at [cyber•Talk Thread](http://cybertalks.org/t/rating-listing-of-cryptocurrencies-and-cryptoassets/353)

## How to add a crowdsale?
Crowdsale consist of 2 steps:
- Before the start. We recommend to add this information at least a month before ETA.
- After the finish. We recommend to add this information in an hour after finish.

### Basic Due Diligence
We don't accept crowdfunding if certain condition didn't met:

- At least one genesis address exist. We don't accept crowdfunding if investors could not transparently track funds.
- Fund management is at least under 2 of 3 multisig. Fund managers could be anonymous, but some reputation inside community is highly recommended. Otherwise, well written paper or POC code eliminates any questions.
- Funding terms are defined and cryptographically signed by fund managers.
To add crowdfunding put this data to toml file of your system.

### Before
```toml
[crowdsales]
start_date = "2015-03-31T00:00:00" or [ ["blockchain", "Ethereum"], ["block", "3798640"] ]
end_date = "2015-05-15T00:00:00"
genesis_address = ["35gLt5EgB367enjSjyEDahhWWcy6p1MGf6"] # Could be array. See multu currency crowdsale
funding_url = "https://koinify.com/#/project/FACTOM"
funding_terms = "http://blog.factom.org/post/115139137794/the-factoid-software-sale-is-live"
min_investment = 0.01
funding_operator = "Koinify" # Could be `nein`.
crowsale_feed = "http://example.com/feed" # For multi currency or non bitcoin crowdsale
```
Note that all fields are mandatory.

### After
Then crowdsale is finished two liner report is needed.
```toml
tokens_sold = 4379973
tokens_issued = 8759946
btc_raised = 3500
```

### Fixed Cap Calculation
After end of crowdsale your cap will be calculated automatically based on 4 fields: `start_date`, `end_date`, `min_invesment` and `genesis_address`. Thus your project will become visible in [Rating](https://cyber.fund) with fixed cap until tokens (1) won't be distributed and (2) at least one public market will be established.

### Multi Currency Crowdsale
You can provide multiple addresses as array: `["address1", "address2"]`.

> At this point of time we support only Bitcoin addresses for crowdsale calculations. For multi currency crowdsale or non bitcoin crowdsale you will need to provide pre calculated feed.

## How to add my site?
It is easy!
Follow [links](#links) section.

## Specification of .toml file

### Basic info
```toml
genesis_id = "hash_of_the_first_block"
system = "System Name"
icon = "system_name"
Should never be changed.
```

`genesis_id`
- Hash of the first block generated by System
- ID wich can define asset in the blockchain

`system` -  The unique name of a system. If there exist system with name in respect to communities please invent another name. In case of historical collisions (Bytecoin for instance) priority will have a system with older genesis date. Newer system will be excluded until renamed. Go to a `/chaingear/sourses` to explore systems names or type in a Search at [cyber.fund](https://cyber.fund/)

`dependencies` - Specify dependencies on other systems.
Names of the systems you can find in `/chaingear/sourses`
```
example
```

`icon` - The name of image of a system logotype (for example `icon` = `"bitcoin"`)

Put image file in to a `/chaingear/logos` folder.

Image requirements:
- file should be .png
- background should be transparent
- file name should be exact of system name ???
- image should be square
- image should have resolution between 256x256 and 1024x1024
